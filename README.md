# Brown-Bag-CLI

## What is the Command Line?
The Command Line Interface is a textual interface which allows user(s) to interact with a system.

## How do you interact with it?
The user(s) are able to type commands into the terminal window because of the shell (ie. bash, cmd, powershell, etc) which facilitates communication between the operating system and the user.  While the list of commands can vary between shell environments, most of them are perform similar functions.  I will be covering the Bourne-Again SHell (BASH) that comes with Linux systems in this presentation.
